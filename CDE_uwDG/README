We consider the Convection-Diffusion Equation with very small diffusion coefficient $\mu$:
\[
-mu\Delta u + \mathbf{\beta}\dot\nabla u =f \mathrm{in}~ \Omega
u=g(x,y) \mathrm{on}~ partial\Omega
\]
First we use the Convection-Diffusion Equation function of The Classical PDE Interfaces in COMSOL 4.4.
Then, we use the WeakForm PDE function and choose shape function type to be discontinuous Largrange.
We compare these two solutions.
